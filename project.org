* Ideas
** Only one tutorial level, try to complete achievements and find secrets
** Only one boss fight
** Only one button, rhythm game where you control a cube on ice and every beat the movement vector rotates 90 degrees. Press space to move in that direction.
*** One button rhythm golf
** You can do only one thing at a time
** Only one of each keyboard key
*** Each tile on map is assigned a key, press that key to make your character hop to that tile
*** Try to lure monsters onto tiles where you can jump on
*** Bullet hell.
*** Some squares have items that you can use:
**** Bombs that you can throw on squares
**** Potions that restore dead keys
**** Arrows you can shoot in some direction
